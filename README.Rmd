# CORALIS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CORALIS is to statistically analyze the interactions between non-coding RNA and their target genes . To this end CORALIS gathers experimentally validated interactions from miRTarbase and RNAInter database into a single database that will work as background when performing the analysis. The hypergeometric distribution test has been chosen to determine enriched target genes given a list of non-coding RNAs in [miRBase](http://www.mirbase.org/search.shtml) format for microRNA-target enrichment analysis (ie: 'hsa-miR-3196') or [Official Gene Symbol](https://www.genenames.org/) format for the rest of ncRNAs (i.e: 'RUNX2'). 

You can install both the released and the development version of CORALIS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Daniel-VM/CORALIS")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
```{r setup, include = FALSE, message=FALSE}
devtools::document()
```


```{r example}
# LOAD PACKAGES
library(CORALIS)

# Load ncRNA IDs data
data(rnasID)
# help("ids")
head(ids)

# Run target enrichment analysis using as input a set of microARN IDs:
head(ids[["miRNAs"]])

# Execute enrcichment statistics with tienrich
tar_mir<-tienrich(input_list=ids[['miRNAs']], min = 2, fdr = 1, organism='Homo sapiens', type = 'miRNA_mRNA')

# View target enrichment analysis output
# View(tar_mir)

# Output visualization
bar <- nodeVisu(obj = tar_mir,
                top=25,
                type = "barplot") %>% print

net <- nodeVisu(obj = tar_mir, 
                top = 25, 
                fixedsize = FALSE, # if true, deafult node size is fixed
                type = "network") %>% print
```
